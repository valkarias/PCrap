# Pa Update Log

### PBuild
- [PBuild](https://github.com/valkarias/PBuild) has been separated to its own repository to facilitate testing.
- Major polishes & refactors to PBuild code-wise.

**{+}:** You can no more download PBuild from this repository releases section, as PBuild got separated from the language, you can obtain it at its own repository [here](https://github.com/valkarias/PBuild)

### Note
- The development on Pa itself is going to slow down, the reason being is that there is an IDE in the work in the aim to improve the tooling!
