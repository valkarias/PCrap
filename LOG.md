# Pa Update Log

- Added `sleep(seconds)` function to the `Time` native module.
- Fixed a typo bug that used the incorrect argument count in `OP_TAIL_CALL`.
- `toString()` supports converting class methods.
- `Random.choice(list)` errors if given `list` is empty.

### Note
- The development on Pa itself is going to slow down, the reason being is that there is an IDE in the work in the aim to improve the tooling!
