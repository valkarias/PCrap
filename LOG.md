# Pa Update Log

### A Rebrand
- We decided to re-name the language to its current name, althougth it's sounds weird, it's not weirder than the previous name. The name was simply *picked* it sounded simplistic enough and very readable and most importantly, being easily picked and *digested* by the hungry searching algorithms hopefully across most platforms used for so.  

**But, What does it mean?** Well a suggestion popped into the heads was to rename it to simply **P**, but thats already a well established language, then another suggestion popped and it was **P\*** and i personally think its still not as *attractive* in any aspect, and, finally **Pa** came into the mind! So, about the meaning of it? it can mean different things but it mostly stands for (you might be familiar with it) *Father*.

### Late Patches
- Fixed private methods access anywhere in a class.
- Added the ability to display and work with big hex literals!  

**{+}:** Complete overhaul of the [Dictionary Example](https://github.com/valkarias/Pa/blob/master/examples/Dictionary.pc), its now an actually functioning hashmap with proper algorithms.
