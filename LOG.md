# Pa Update Log

### PBuild
- PBuild code-wise is now completely refactored, as-well as providing 1 single executable in its zip-file instead of a folder now.
- The `version` command in PBuild correctly displays the current installed language's version, and offers option `--latest` to display the latest version from the github repo instead.

### Note
- The development on Pa itself is going to slow down, the reason being is that there is an IDE in the work in the aim to improve the tooling!
