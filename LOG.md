# Pa Update Log

### Few Notes & Changes
- 2 new properties added to the ``Time`` module:   
    `dayName` to display the weekday name, and `monthName` to display the current month's name.  

- New ``Path.listDir`` method used to display the contents of a directory:
```
use Path;

Path.listDir(".") //returns a list of current directory's content.
```

### Note
- The development on Pa itself is going to drastically slow down, the reason being is that there is an IDE in the work in the aim to improve the tooling! (Major progress is being made)
